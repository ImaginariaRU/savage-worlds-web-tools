#Savage Worlds Web Tools

###GitHub Hosted Application Page

###Overview
This is a collection of javascript web applications for the Savage Worlds pen and paper role playing system owned by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. 

A few may question why I chose HTML/JS for this app instead of traditional compile and distrubute. The primary reason was accessiblity. I can use the same code on an iPad, a Mac Pro, a Windows XP machine, Linux and even my daughter's Kindle. I'm not afraid of closing my source up so the the accessabiliy of javascript (although the distributed code is minified) was a bonus to me not a burden. 

Since this really doesn't do any processor intensive calculations, JavaScript does well for pushing around variables and objects for such low-intensive purposes. *IF* I were to recreate this, I'd probably write it in C++ using the Qt framework, but that'd require multiple accounts and distribution and complitaion methods ("ain't nobody got time for that!").

I expect bugs, please feel free to point them out to me by tweeting me at the top of the hosted github application and I'll get on it as soon as I can.
