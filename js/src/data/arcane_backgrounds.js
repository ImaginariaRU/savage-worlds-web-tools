The player and Game Master should come up with a simple list of what is important to the character\'s religion and use this as a guide. Champions who violate their beliefs are temporarily or permanently forsaken by their chosen deity. Minor sins give the character a ‚Ä"2 to his Faith rolls for one week.

This particular level of power is intended for relatively low-level ‚Äúpulp‚Äù heroes. More powerful super types are dealt with in specific Savage Settings, and you\'ll find an alternate and far more detailed system in our Super Powers Companion. Super powers work a little differently from most other Arcane Backgrounds‚Ä"each power is its own skill and has no linked attribute (and thus counts as ‚Äúlower‚Äù than its linked Attribute for purposes of Advancement). A hero with the armor and bolt powers, for example, also has an Armor and a Bolt skill he uses to enable it. It\'s more expensive for a character to improve his powers, but he starts with more Power Points than other arcane types so he can use his abilities more often. Best of all, there are no drawbacks for super powers as there are with other types of arcane powers‚Ä"the power either works or it doesn\'t.',
