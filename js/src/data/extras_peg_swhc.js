		 'en-US': 'Will o&acirc;&euro;&trade; wisps are the ghosts of witches and necromancers who have been burned at the stake. They manifest as small handfuls of  flickering white flame that is oddly cold to the touch rather than hot. Legend claims a brave observer can see a grinning face inside of a will o&acirc;&euro;&trade; wisp.\nA will o&acirc;&euro;&trade; wisp uses the glimmering light produced by its form to lure its intended victim to a secluded spot. There, it weakens the poor soul with a  re that seems to spring from Hell itself. Once its target succumbs to the heat, the ghost possesses his corpse which immediately bursts aflame. These burning zombies are sometimes referred to as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;flaming jacks,&acirc;&euro; particularly among more rural populations. The ghost uses the reanimated body to wreak as much havoc as it can before it is consumed by the creature&acirc;&euro;&trade;s otherworldly  ames&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;preferably on those it believes wronged it in its former life.\nInitially, a will o&acirc;&euro;&trade; wisp haunts the area near its death, seeking vengeance on those responsible for any and all wrongdoings against it during life. However, even once it has revenged itself on everyone guilty of even the slightest infraction, the hatred and anger that drove it to an undead existence continues to burn within the ghost. Eventually, these spirits tend to gravitate toward lonely, desolate areas where their unnatural spite for all things living leads them to prey upon unsuspecting travelers.\nThe process by which a will o&acirc;&euro;&trade; wisp is formed is a closely guarded secret among the few practitioners of the dark arts that know it and often varies greatly in the details. Invariably though, it involves the creation of a talisman of some sort which must be on the black magician at the time of his death and which serves as the ghost&acirc;&euro;&trade;s anchor to this plane. The talisman is not consumed in the  ames, but remains ever after searing hot to the touch.\nThe light of a will o&acirc;&euro;&trade; wisp varies from cold white to  flame orange. The ghost can lessen its brilliance to that of a mere candle or brighten it to that of a torch at will.',
