The barrier ranges in thickness from a few ‚Äúreal world‚Äù inches for stone or other hard materials up to a foot for things like bones or ice. (If you\'re using a gridded mat to play, draw the barrier between the squares directly along the grid-lines.) The exact placement of each section is de ned by the caster, but each section must be connected to at least one other section after the first.\nWhen the spell expires or a section is broken, it crumbles to dust or dissipates. Trappings are never left behind.\nEach section of the barrier may be destroyed by an attack that equals its Toughness of 10. Physical walls are treated exactly like inanimate objects; they are considered to have a Parry of 2 (ranged attacks work as normal), but raises on the attack roll do not grant bonus damage nor do damage dice Ace. Opponents may climb the barrier at ‚Ä"2 to their Climbing roll if it is made of something solid. Fiery versions of the barrier cause 2d4 damage to anyone who wishes to leap through instead.',
